# Snake Game
The Snake Game written on Rust with ggez.
## The Game 
You're playing as a snake livng on a small hexagonal island in the The Big Void. You're lonely and hungry. There's no one else there with you, but there's always exactly one apple. 
You're goal is to roam the land and eat as many as you can. But beware of the island edges - once you fall you're journey's over!
You hope that once you become bigger and stronger you could finally leave. But you'll soon find out that that has its consequences too...
